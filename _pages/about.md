Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P. O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md` . Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, I'm Nick — a software engineer based in Taipei who enjoys building apps that make life a little easier. I specialize in iOS and Android development, with 9+ years of experience in Swift and Objective-C, and 6+ years with Kotlin.

By day, I work in the IoT field, creating apps that bridge the physical and digital worlds. I'm also into network protocols (HTTP, MQTT, WebSocket, RTSP, etc.), video streaming, AR, and I love automating routine tasks using tools like Docker, Jenkins, Fastlane, and Gradle.

I care deeply about clean code, SOLID principles, and scalable architecture. I’m a fan of design patterns and enjoy bringing thoughtful structure into the software I build. Over the years, I’ve introduced architectures like MVP and VIPER into team projects to boost maintainability and collaboration.

Outside of work, I'm into psychology, running, and challenging myself. In April 2025, I completed my first half marathon — a reminder to “just do it.” I believe in taking the leap, because you’ll never know unless you try. I also spend my free time building side projects to solve real-world problems, with the long-term goal of starting my own software company.

If you're into meaningful products, clean architecture, or just want to say hi — feel free to reach out!

嗨，我是 Nick，一位居住在台北的軟體工程師，喜歡打造能讓生活更便利一點的 App。我專注於 iOS 和 Android 開發，擁有超過 9 年的 Swift／Objective-C 經驗，以及超過 6 年的 Kotlin 經驗。

白天我在 IoT 領域工作，開發串聯虛實世界的應用程式。我對各種網路協定（像是 HTTP、MQTT、WebSocket、RTSP 等）、影音串流與 AR 技術很有興趣，也喜歡用 Docker、Jenkins、Fastlane、Gradle 等工具來自動化例行工作流程，讓我能更專注在寫出好程式。

我重視乾淨的程式碼、SOLID 原則與可擴展的架構，熱衷於設計模式，並樂於把這些思維落實到專案中。這些年來，我也曾在團隊中導入 MVP 與 VIPER 等架構模式，提升專案的可維護性與合作效率。

工作之外，我對心理學有興趣，也喜歡跑步與挑戰自我。2025 年 4 月，我完成了人生第一場半馬，那是我實踐「Just do it」這句座右銘的時刻。我相信，有些事就是要勇敢去嘗試，不去做，你永遠不知道自己能做到什麼。平常我也會利用空閒時間開發 side project，解決生活中的問題，長期目標是創立一家自己的軟體公司。

如果你也對有意義的產品、乾淨的架構有興趣，或只是想打聲招呼，歡迎隨時聯絡我！
